This repo contains datasets related to state elections in New Jersey. While
this data is already made publicly available by the 
[NJ Division of Elections](https://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/election-information.shtml),
only PDF files are provided. The code in this repo extracts the data from these
PDFs and provides it in CSV files.

Note: I did not extract all of the data provided in the PDFs.

For now, this repo only contains 2017 General Assembly election results.
